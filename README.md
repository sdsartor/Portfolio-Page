# Portfolio-Page

## Description

This page was created to show off my projects and establish an about me page to make me more presentable to employers.  This page was made solely out of css styling and includes an animated cartoon of a figure that resembles me.  This page also has a working navigation bar and a functional project page that flips around to show a link to the deployed pages and code.

## Installation

In order to install this project, you must be able to use a coding interface that works with react and have the proper `npx` command established.  The proper dependencies should install by typing in `cd 00-sad-app`, `npm i` or `npm install`, `npm run build`, and `npm start`.  In order to create the app on your own machine, you must type in `npx create-react-app 00-sad-app`, wait for it to download and install all of the data for the app, `remove the package-lock.json and node_modules`, change the `react` and `react-dom` to `17.0.2`, change the `@testing-library/react` to `11.1.0`, and `npm i` to update the package.json.

## Usage

This website is mainly going to be used to display my projects and give the viewer a brief description of me and establish a connection with future employers.  The template resembles a normal multi section page portfolio and has many css images and blend modes used to get the website to pop out at the viewer.
